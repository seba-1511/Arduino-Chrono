An Arduino-based chronometer for Tooski

Warning: This project is still in Beta, so some things may or may not work. If you find a problem, bug or have an idea don't hesitate to send me a message. It always makes people happy, right ?

Here is all the files I used to build my own chronometer. It was initialy an idea for the website Tooski.ch, so made for skiers, and that's why the text on the screen is in French. However it is really easy to modify it and to understand the code, as the comments are in English.

It is based on Arduino, uses Xbee for wireless communication (~300m) and the detectors are using IR beams to detect when something goes through them. By the way I take this occasion to thank Ken Shirriff for his library that helped a lot !

Once again critics, comments and suggestions are really welcome, and keep in mind I may do errors, so point them out to me. Also if you modify or improve my code, let me know because I'll be happy to see what you've done.
