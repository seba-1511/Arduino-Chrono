<p>An Arduino-based chronometer for Tooski</p>

<p>Warning: This project is still in Beta, so some things may or may not work. If you find a problem, bug or have an idea don't hesitate to send me a message. It always makes people happy, right ?</p>

<h2>Presentation</h2>

<p>Here are all the files I used to build my own chronometer. It was initialy an idea for the website Tooski.ch, so made for skiers, and that's why the text on the screen is in French. However it is really easy to modify it and to understand the code, as the comments are in English.</p>

<p>It is based on Arduino, uses Xbee for wireless communication (~300m) and the detectors are using IR beams to detect when something goes through them. By the way I take this occasion to thank Ken Shirriff for his library that helped a lot ! If you go throught the folders, you will find the part list, the schematics and of course the commented Arduino code. Not to mention that there is also the instructions on how to use it once you are done building it.</p>

<p>Once again critics, comments and suggestions are really welcome, and keep in mind I may do errors, so point them out to me. Also if you modify or improve my code, let me know because I'll be happy to see what you've done.</p>

<p>You can see a video of the prototype here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61YS39FGn74">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61YS39FGn74</a></p>

<h2>Futur implementations:</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Storing the times into an SD card and make a table out of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow multiple skiers at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>Implementing a camera that takes a photo when the chrono starts.</p></li>
<li><p>Having a camera that films you only from when the chrono starts to when it ends.</p></li>
